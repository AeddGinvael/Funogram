# Funogram

# Work in progress

Old methods moved in `Funogram.Rest` module.
New more functional api available in `Funogram.Api` module.

Not recommended to use functions who ends with `Base`, because it's may be changed in future. If you want to use this functions, you need to minimize usage of it (write wrapper, for example).
